### In the beginning...

Gordy and Aaron have been partners for over 12 years, and they like to say that they work in the realm
of “Everything is Possible”. But, in the beginning, it wasn’t clear that anything at all would be
possible.

During the height of Pay Per Click arbitrage in 2006, Gordy discovered one of
Aaron’s websites and immediately called Aaron. Aaron hung up. Gordy persisted
– even getting the next flight over to Vancouver Island to meet Aaron. The
next day Aaron flew to Vancouver to meet the team. Ever since then the two
have been practically inseparable.

Over the years they continued to develop companies in the advertising
industry, until a fundamental question arose: What legacy am I leaving on this
world? Over the next years it grew into a mission to direct attention to build
a company unlike any they had built before, one focused on contributing value,
rather than extracting it.

          Victoria, BC, rarely sees snow, but in the memorable 2006 brutal winter storm, messages were flying back
          and forth between Gordy and Aaron. Aaron had no power for a week and directed the process from landline.
          By the time Victoria returned to its usual benign weather patterns, the deal was closed
        </p>
        <p>
          The end result was that Samsonoff Media merged with The Guide to Content Publishers, and became Qool Media
          a about 1 year later. The team decided to move to Victoria and make Aaron’s office the homebase for the
          growth of the new company. It soon ballooned to 25 local Victoria staff and 20+ outsourced staff in the
          Philippines, where Aaron met his wife and lived for 3 years. The teams built over 1000 niche content sites
          and drove HFT ad traffic to them.
        </p>
      <p>
          During this period many networks were bridged and invites seem to have come out of nowhere, a true
          imposter syndrome came over Gordy, “How am I here rubbing elbows with these people.” but the message
          resonated so strongly and a shared fundamental question had apparently arisen in many others as well.
          After a few years of increasing competition and greater demands, Gordy was ready to move on by 2009/2010.
          Aaron also stepped away in 2011. However, in 2013 their contacts began to suggest strongly that they
          should get back into the HFT ad space. They put together a development team and built out an automated
          platform that tied into major, existing relationships and we again scaled to 8 figures annually as
          AdLumix.

          By 2014, the focus had begun to change. Gordy and Aaron were having ongoing discussions around what we
          were building, its legacy, and how there was no real value for those whose lives they were touching. They
          both started to take the life journey seriously, and began to engage in a lots of self-discovery
          activities, including going deeply into personal growth opportunities such as Landmark,Tony Robbins and
          multiple spiritual modalities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gordy and Aaron were committed to changing the world and in 2015 launched Conscious Thought Revolution
          (CTR). The overarching theme was: If you want change in the world it starts within.They set out along a
          path to creating businesses and touch points that bring awareness of the mental, emotional, physical and
          spiritual aspects of people’s lives. They wanted to increase awareness of how those influences affect the
          quality of life of each individual and the people surrounding them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of 2017 was spent in discussions between the partners on how best to harness and respect each other’s
          superpowers. Gordy was looking for ways to move fast without having 3 partners needed for all decision
          making. Aaron was looking to move out of advertising and into investing with all his focus and Haafiz wfas
          looking to build an empowering technology platform that helps to raise awareness and consciousness.

### Enacting the Vision of CTR

CTR is a highly-intentional, self-correcting, self-expanding, self-organizing, self-regulating technology platform that measures and expands global levels of human consciousness.

CTR Group of Companies have spent over a decade running HFT ads compiling rich data and actionable insights into consumption. We have shifted our focus from extracting value towards deeply understanding behaviour through our compiled BIG data and we are using that to empower and measure impact by taking advantage of AI and machine learning.

Following the launching of Conscious Thought Revolution, ongoing conversations shaped the concept of CTR and how best to leverage the network and desires of people to make impact in a positive way. The focus turned to some of the doors that had been opened. People wanted to use their money for good, and there really wasn’t a lot to pool and focus that capital into meaningful impact. The partners began to question whether they could start a Venture Capital company.

In 2018, 3 separate high level entities were launched: CTR.ai (haafiz for technology), CTR Capital (Aaron for financial) and CTR.com Ventures -- with Gordy as keeper of the CTR vision and brand building.

### The CTR Conscious Capital Fund (CCF)

It was decided to launch the Conscious Capital Fund under the CTR Capital umbrella in 2018.

CTR partners had been running a private fund of early stage disruptive investments over the previous 5 years and there had been considerable demand to partake in these opportunities. The advantages of CCF are:
· Before the fund was set up, the partners had the pleasure and opportunity of working with a number of founders, investors and companies.
· Due to the partners’ strong network of connectors and influencers they have already been able to secure large allocations of capital for the fund.
· The underlying investment strategy has become more refined, so there have been promising returns in the initial investments.
· Rather than a sole focus on returns the partners also consider the impact of the investments and use the findings to provide insight into what the fund is capable of.

The CCF approach is modelled on some thought-provoking definitions and criteria that are emerging. For example, Peter Diamandis argues that a billionaire is no longer someone whose net worth has that dollar value. Instead, Diamandis claims that a new billionaire is someone who can affect a billion + lives. In light of this, there are a few approaches that the partners are committed to.

For example, the CCF focuses on innovative developments in the industries that have the potential to impact billion + people, or if the intention is to expand “consciousness” or improve individuals and their experience in this life as well the lives of others. And this has the potential for return. Where many previous Conscious VCs have failed is in placing too much focus on the impact and not a continued ability to focus on returns. With more and more B Corporations coming online, and many fundamental shifts in business, we believe the time is now for our type of investment

### Looking Forward to a Conscious Capital Community

The parent company, CTR Capital, is planning to build a community that would include annual events, online sessions with guest speakers, forums and connections, an education platform, as well as myriad other things which supplement a community and allow it to flourish. It will support both sides: the limited partners investing or interested in investing, as well as the founders and companies we invest into.

The community will open the doors for investors to get access to a much larger network of individuals looking to impact the world. As well, it will provide the opportunity to pool capital together with other individuals looking to make impact in the world. A struggle for the generational wealth changing hands is that those investors want to make impact a focus without giving up yield, but there are few opportunities or mentors to direct it. There aren’t enough deals available out there, or the requirements to assess and curate is just not feasible unless it’s a full-time thing.

This opens the doors for CTR to exist as a pre-eminent authority in the Conscious Capital space, which would allow people seeking out the impact with their capital or skills to have a place to go where a lot of the troubles are handled and the framework is set. The goal is to foster a thriving community of companies and individuals who are looking to create the impact and live fulfilled, understanding that the problems we face today often need a new solution. The plan is to provide an opportunity for limited partners and companies to share super powers, whether it be capital or skill, with a larger community.
