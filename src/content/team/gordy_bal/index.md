## Story

Surprisingly, we can draw a clear timeline from the Partition of India in 1947 to the launching of CTR in Canada in 2018. That’s just over 70 years…and it’s quite a tale. In fact, it’s the story of how Gordy Bal found himself in Victoria, British Columbia, helping to launch the Conscious Thought Revolution, and its venture capital fund, Conscious Capital.

Gordy’s father was just a young boy when India gained independence from Britain in 1947 and divided into two separate countries: India and Pakistan. The persecution and bloodshed that Gordy’s father saw as his family escaped to the Punjab left scars, even when as a grown man he emigrated to Canada. Gordy grew up experiencing his father’s alcoholism and the abusive treatment of his mother, and from an early age he searched for the meaning of it all. Gordy also developed a sixth sense as he did what he could as a child to anticipate angry outbursts and defuse situations. He learned to connect the unseen dots to make life bearable in a family home that was far from Leave it to Beaver. He saw the difference that money could make and determined to become rich.

His first entrepreneurial adventures began in elementary school, where he became the middle man in helping the students to trade their valuable possessions. At the same time, he was driven to earn straight As in his academic programs because he saw them as the key to success. In high school, as a child of the Internet, he started making money online. While at UBC, he managed to earn a 4-year degree in 3 years, while launching several small online businesses. He was making money – but he was miserable because, to his surprize, his money wasn’t solving his problems. He lived an unhealthy, unbalanced lifestyle, and was often sick and depressed. He had just convinced himself to take the LSAT when he woke on the morning of September 11th, 2001.

His existential crisis deepened as he watched the 9/11 events on television. The feelings he had had as a child, helplessly watching his family feuding, returned and were amplified. As before, he questioned: What is this? He could see the effects of the media and the power structures in place. He wondered why some people had more money than others. He internalized the mass consumption and the results of fear and greed.

After graduating, he began to set up businesses with Aaron that were related to digital marketing. As he experienced one success after another, it gradually dawned on him that he was part of the problem. He was helping to sell people things they didn’t really need. Once again he began to question the meaning of it all and turned to meditation, a healthier lifestyle and self-development.

His realization grew that humans lacked a collective consciousness that would lead them to help one another. From his marketing experiences he knew that the Big Data gathered could help people to support one another, not just sell them stuff. The key was raising their consciousness. And so he stepped away from his commercial activities to work with Gordy to launch the Conscious Thought Revolution in 2018 and to raise funds to invest in conscious capital. This was just the start.
