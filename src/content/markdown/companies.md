While there are those that are currently unbanked or not involved in the traditional financial system as they are in areas that remain exempt from being included, many fintech companies are providing solutions to problems within and outside of traditional financial services, creating and supporting an inclusive web that seeks to push every economy into one massively open and shared global online financial economy.

We’ve seen that in the last 100 years that a correlation exists, between an expanding financial industry and a rising income inequality.
