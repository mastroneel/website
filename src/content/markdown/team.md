## Aaron Samsonoff
### Story
Aaron didn’t have a paper route when he was a boy.  He had several.  And he was using the $2,000 he earned monthly to fund his entrepreneurial endeavours. The discipline of getting up at 4:30 in the morning to deliver newspapers turned into a lifelong habit of rising early. Thinking about Big Hairy Audacious Goals while he walked from door to door in the pre-dawn was just one inspiration for taking post-secondary courses in computer science and business.

In his twenties, Aaron began to launch online businesses, and he learned to smile at failures.  There were many.  But the smiles came because he knew that he was gaining knowledge from each failed effort that would help him to move along the path to success. In 2004, he applied all those knowledges into building his first successful digital marketing company, Samsonoff Media, which after several buyouts and mergers morphed into Qool Media. After that, successes began to overtake failures as he established more e-commerce and digital marketing initiatives.

Trusting in the Big Banks to invest and manage  the small fortune was beginning to acquire seemed like a good idea – until 2008 arrived.  Losing money was not a new experience, but it did make him decide to manage his own investments from then on.  By 2011/12, he had proved to himself that he was good at growing his own money, but was feeling the need to invest in value-driven companies that were committed to resolving issues such as environmental change, world poverty and sustainable agriculture.

He teamed up with a kindred spirit, Gordy Bal, to get involved in the new movement towards conscious capitalism. In 2016,  they created Conscious Thought Revolution(CTR) – a platform dedicated to the expansion of human consciousness.  Its stated mission is: “To shift old paradigms that no longer serve us by building, supporting and investing in radical innovations that disrupt these old paradigms in all sectors”.

Interest grew. Other investors were asking to pool their resources with Aaron and Gordy to invest in companies that were subscribing to the ideals of conscious capitalism.

So in 2018, the Conscious Capital Fund was set up under the umbrella of CTR. Its mission is to bring together like-minded investors who want to provide venture capital to companies who are raising human consciousness of the plight of the planet, in order to effect change.  The work has just begun. You are welcome to contribute and be part of the solution. Click here to find out more!

## Alexander Urban
### Story
Taking a taxi from New York to Washington DC when he was in his teens helped Alex to realize that money matters.  The $1,500 fare was the price he paid for an important  life lesson in planning, prioritizing and spending wisely.

And he had to learn quickly, because after the taxi driver dropped him at his parents home later that day, they presented him with just three options: go back to school, get a job, or leave home.  He chose to get a job. But, in fact, he created a job.

The next day he grabbed some gardening tools from the family barn and went to every home in a 2 ½ mile radius to ask if they needed yard work done.  He just asked to be paid what the work was worth.  At the end of that first day he presented his parents with $700 that he had earned.  They let him stay.

Just like that he was in business. And he had unexpectedly discovered an important principle that would guide him as an entrepreneur for the next 10 years  – provide services that people need.

Alex expanded his yard maintenance to meet the demand for commercial maintenance, he hired others to work for him, and diversified into related fields, including industrial grill maintenance, home repair and limited additions. When looking after the land in a country club, he concluded that people with expensive cars would appreciate having their cars washed while they were playing golf.

In his twenties he was ready for a new direction, and he found it in Barnes and Noble wrapped in a book called High Powered Investing for Dummies. He read and then re-read this 4,000 page book and set about learning all he could about the stock market.  After investing in equities, and futures and options trading, he hit his stride with foreign exchange.

In 2007/2008 the time was right to use his skills in FX, and there were fortunes to be made and lost.  After a hectic time of earning large profits, only to see them disappear, he had learned a lot so Alex decided it was time to work with other people’s money, not just his own, and he turned to trading.  Cryptocurrencies caught his attention at a time when there were just a few available. Acting on impulse, he messaged a businessman whose picture was on the front page of Forbes magazine, and much to his surprise got a reply that led him to work in the inner circles of businesses that taught him a great deal.

Then in 2013/2014, Kollan introduced him to Gordy and Aaron, and Alex joined them all in British Columbia, Canada, to work with them.  He spent a considerable time learning about marketing from Aaron and he mastered all the terms used in advertising and digital marketing.  Interesting though that was, Alex soon realized it was not the field he wanted to work in so he left the west coast and returned to the east coast.

By now,  he wanted to invest in something more tangible, and so began to buy into rental properties. His portfolio of properties soon grew to 26, and profits were to be made.  However, he was unhappy with the rate of evictions and seeing families having to give up homes because of non-payment.  He also encountered dishonest property managers who were charging for repairs not completed, and so launched his own property management company.  Other real estate investors were soon using his company to manage their properties which grew to 110 and he also devised a platform that could be used to alert investors to renters who might soon have to be evicted, when there were maintenance issues, late payments, etc.

As always, Alex was filling people’s needs – but his heart wasn’t in it, and he sold his properties and the related companies. He began to follow some of his other interests, such as buying and selling on Amazon and eBay.  He found profitable niches and people to partner with, but it was a blow when one of those partners proved to have a gambling addiction and had partnered with a dishonest accountant to embezzle funds.  Once again, Alex stepped away.

Alex had decided that loyalty, social awareness and  honest dealing were other principles that he wanted to use to guide him, and at that time he re-connected with Kollan who was involved in conscious capital initiatives with Gordy and Aaron.  This was an opportunity to be pay attention to raising consciousness of the human condition and to address issues such as poverty, climate change and hunger.

The early lessons about the importance of money stay with Alex, but now his focus is on raising money to improve the condition of the world and the status of others.  He’s looking forward to seeing  what can be achieved.

## Kollan House
### Story
As the son of a physician in the military, Kollan had been used to moving around.  But he became the man of the house when he was only 5.  His parents were separating and as the older brother of a two younger siblings, he felt it was up to him to help his mother.  Perhaps it was those early responsibilities that prepared him for a life of running things.  

Kollan grew up looking after his younger brother and sister while his mother worked long hours to support them. Often they had to rely on food stamps,  but life was good apart from that.  What he recalls about his Christian elementary school was that his essay on the adaptation of plants got a low grade because it championed evolution, and such ideas were not welcome. However, his father in particular encouraged scientific thought, and became more of an influence when Kollan lived with him in Kentucky through his high school years.

Kollan moved out on his own at 18, and suffered through a period of depression.  Engineering school called, and he started working to support himself. UPS, based in Kentucky, had program to fund students if they would work the third, overnight shift. Kollan was soon promoted to manager and took management training. Before too long he was supervising 40 people. 

But it was difficult to keep up with his studies, and Kollan decided to focus on engineering. In his third year, his aptitude for business was evident as he started getting work building websites and helping people with their computers. He was ahead of the curve because he understood the value of having an online presence, but it was an uphill battle to persuade others.
   
Kollan’s early goal was to build spaceships. He had wanted to be pilot, and he earned his private pilot’s license.  He also loved to make things with his hands, and won an art scholarship – which he declined because he realized that he was unlikely to turn it into a successful career.  Elon Musk was his hero and it was the early days of Burt Rutan’s race into space. When he realized that it took a million dollars to fund space travel,  and that it was mainly wealthy businessmen who had those resources, he turned his attention to business studies.

Around this time, Kollan’s father was involved in some startups, such as a black limo taxi service for airline passengers. Kollan worked with him and learned quickly that there were a lot of regulatory bodies who needed to be satisfied.  Ultimately, that business failed, but it gave him a good idea of what was needed to survive.  He and a friend started another limo service, this time shuttling people around who were attending the Kentucky Derby. However, his friend proved unreliable, and and he left Kollan to deal with a shambles.

Kollan was left feeling depressed and living in his parents basement. Even with help for the depression, he could find no meaning in his life, and he attempted suicide.  He was saved from a fatal  jump from a 7-storey building by getting caught up in some wires. He was surrounded by love as a result and it was almost as though he had died and gone to heaven.  People were worried that he would try suicide again, but he felt he had survived his best efforts to kill himself, so he focused on finding meaning by reading such authors as Eckhart Tolle.  

Life took a new turn when Kollan met Alex and Tim at a Hackathon in Washington. They invited him to move from Kentucky to join them in Baltimore to work in the field of cryptocurrency. Even though he was still limping from his fall, he moved in with them in their cramped quarters and 
that was the start of a very exciting time when they motivated each other to do well.

Then Kollan met up with Gordy and Aaron and came to BC – originally with Tim and Alex, but eventually they moved back to the US.  During the past  4 years in BC, Kollan has struggled to be a successful entrepreneur and feels he has grown and found his own voice.  He has discovered that there is a greater willingness to collaborate on the west coast and fewer man-eat-man business dealings. 

Kollan has learned from Gordy and Aaron about why conscious capital matters.  He has worn many different hats, and has develop his innate abilities to be adaptable and problem solve.  He has enjoyed applying the scientific method he learned as an engineer to efficiently solve challenges that involve humans.    
Now Kollan has a 20-year plan to be successful in business – and he then he wants to build a spaceship.
