        "a": "While the Conscious Capital Fund investments are based on its criteria and thesis, we do consider all opportunities. That being said we tend to focus on Transformative Technology and within that space, specific themes like Disruptive Health, Human Potential, Climate Rehabilitation, Fintech, Blockchain and Digital Assets.

      {
        "q": "How do you weigh different criteria in your decision-making process?",
        "a": "We have developed a list of objective scales. For example, the founder of an organization having previous success is rated highly, but it is not necessary for a company to meet all criteria with high marks to be included in the CCF portfolio. Our key areas of focus are on the founder(s), the team, the product and business model so these are the highest scored areas. Other considerations made are deal structure, industry, potential scale and innovation. However, although those are important, they are more likely to be subjective, therefore we rank them lower.",

        "q": "What do you look for in an idea?",
        "a": "Truth be told, ideas are a dime a dozen, so we tend to focus far more on the team. That being said, we look for ideas that have significance. We’re seeking disruptive potential, innovative techniques and a large market – and a vibrant, intelligent, determined team to turn ideas into reality.",

        "q": "How do you get access to deals?",
        "a": "Our Fund Managers utilize two main strategies. The first is passive: Having cultivated a network of investors and entrepreneurs who have their ear to the ground, they send us deals they have vetted through and believe meet the Fund’s thesis. The second strategy is active and aggressive: We passionately search physical and online avenues for founders and companies that are providing solutions to problems we see stone-walling the path of the Fund’s vision.

        "q": "How do we measure impact?",
        "a": "The Return on Impact is judged by a number of factors, but for example: The company’s employees Who are the people Are those employees compensated fairly and on par with, or above industry standard? Ie The disparity multiple between a companies highest paid employee and their lowest paid employee What those employees spend their money on and where  How the employees feel (through something like a Net Promoter Score) How likely they are to promote their company to a stranger or close friend I.E. as an investment (if company were public) Or as a place for employment The company’s contractors Who the company contracts with, for example how much they are involved in leveraging wage discrepancies or exploitation Whether the company is willing to work with overseas manufacturers versus domestic Whether the company is willing to work with a company accused of improprieties, illegal dealings, etc for lowest cost of goods or services   The company’s users Who the company’s users, clients or customers are How much impact the company, its products or its services have on the lives of employees and stakeholders, and how the company perceives those individuals What is the impact the company makes on local markets and regional economies What is the “Trickle down economics” of this company Where the money it pays contractors, and employees ultimately ends up Where the money it receives ultimately ends up The company What is the perceived image of the company as a whole among the general population How does the company show it cares. What is the company most and least prideful of How does the company rate at a macro level when compared against the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for transforming our world.",

        "a": "We have inbound deal flow which hits the first screening process, from there we build a list of questions related to the industry, market and business itself to be reviewed and then asked of the founding team, we then do comprehensive due diligence and at any point in time we have additional questions we will construct and have a meeting with the team to answer. Afterwards we do an evaluation with considerations made and do a legal and compliance review. This process can take up to three weeks.  First, inbound deal flow, we look at the opportunities and perform an initial review of the business as it has been presented to us, we look into the industry and market, the background of the team, outline the opportunity and produce a list of questions we have for the founding team to help fill in the gaps marketing materials may leave.  Second, we have an initial call where we get introduced (if it hasn’t happened already) as well as have the initial set of questions answered. If these are well answered then we will move into the third stage.  Third, we perform our comprehensive due diligence where we have our research team create a report on the market opportunity, industry, product, team, and business model, we will also review the legal structure. During this time we may have questions created which will then be reviewed and prepared for additional conversations with the founding team.  Fourth, we have a meeting with our team which we outline the findings assess the opportunity and then vote on a decision of how to proceed.  Fifth, we will have the legal team review all documents and ensure everything is prepared and the investment is ready to be made.",

We believe that indeed you cannot solve the problems with the same thinking used when they were created and as such you require the diverse thought and inclusion to produce a desired result. Not to mention the countless studies produced over the last decade indicating that diversity leads to better results, more novel approaches and unique solutions, but also the understanding that the world we hope to create is a diverse world with many different ideas and opportunities. CTR cannot lead that charge, it will the people who are a part of the vision and mission who do.  Therefore we look to have diversity and inclusion at every level of all that we do.",

Great hiring is something that comes with the experience of doing it, each business has its own unique environment and culture so we work with team members to develop and understand what is needed and what those “make it or break it” points are. Like any successful relationship there are many considerations to make as well as establishing processes to ensure compliance and growth. We take culture and team as one of the highest priorities and indicators for success of a startup so it’s something which is often overlooked, to the extreme detriment of the company.",

CTR in the past has done many private placements and during that period we have built a strong network of individuals who align with the mission and vision of CTR. We see the need for conscious investing and a need for a conscious thought revolution as paramount for the continued development of humanity. The previous success of the private placements and the desire of our network to continue to have the impact of consciousness measured and grown has lead us into a unique opportunity of timing. The capital and the opportunities have met and it is this time we’re in a position to develop and operate a fund to enact that vision and lead the revolution.",
