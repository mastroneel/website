## Bio

Kollanâ€™s fascination with the operational side of business stems from his childhood, when he spent many hours figuring out how to build and launch a spaceship. His love of science and of running projects comes from those early days too. As a young engineering student, he paid for his tuition by working part-time for UPS, and was supervising a team of 40 people before he left. That management experience paid off when Kollan turned his attention to building online businesses and successful ventures in the world of cryptocurrencies. Looking for more meaning in his work, Kollan teamed up with Gordy and Aaron and is now committed to the values of conscious capitalism. The spaceship will still have to wait while he launches new initiatives to address the challenges right here on earth.
