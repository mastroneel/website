        "q": "How do you weigh different criteria in your decision-making process?",
        "a": "We have developed a list of objective scales. For example, the founder of an organization having previous success is rated highly, but it is not necessary for a company to meet all criteria with high marks to be included in the CCF portfolio. Our key areas of focus are on the founder(s), the team, the product and business model so these are the highest scored areas. Other considerations made are deal structure, industry, potential scale and innovation. However, although those are important, they are more likely to be subjective, therefore we rank them lower.",

The first is passive: Having cultivated a network of investors and entrepreneurs who have their ear to the ground, they send us deals they have vetted through and believe meet the Fund’s thesis. The second strategy is active and aggressive: We passionately search physical and online avenues for founders and companies that are providing solutions to problems we see stone-walling the path of the Fund’s vision.

        "a": "We have inbound deal flow which hits the first screening process. From there we build a list of questions related to the industry, market and business itself to be reviewed and then asked of the founding team. We then do comprehensive due diligence and if at any point in time we have additional questions we will construct and have a meeting with the team to answer. Afterwards we do an evaluation with considerations made and do a legal and compliance review. This process can take up to three weeks, and the following is a more detailed overview.<br /><br />First, inbound deal flow: We look at the opportunities and perform an initial review of the business as it has been presented to us. We look into the industry and market, the background of the team, and the outline of the opportunity. We then produce a list of questions we have for the founding team to help fill in the gaps marketing materials may leave.<br /><br />Second, we have an initial call where we get introduced (if it hasn’t happened already) as well as have the initial set of questions answered. If these are well answered then we will move into the third stage.<br /><br />Third, we perform our comprehensive due diligence where we have our research team create a report on the market opportunity, industry, product, team, and business model. We will also review the legal structure. During this time we may have questions which will then be reviewed and prepared for additional conversations with the founding team.<br /><br />Fourth, we have a meeting with our team which we outline the findings assess the opportunity and then vote on a decision as to how to proceed.<br /><br />Fifth, we will have the legal team review all documents and ensure everything is prepared and the investment is ready to be made.",

We believe that indeed you cannot solve the problems with the same thinking used when they were created and as such you require the diverse thought and inclusion to produce a desired result. Not to mention the countless studies produced over the last decade indicating that diversity leads to better results, more novel approaches and unique solutions, but also the understanding that the world we hope to create is a diverse world with many different ideas and opportunities. CTR cannot lead that charge, it will the people who are a part of the vision and mission who do.  Therefore we look to have diversity and inclusion at every level of all that we do.",

Like any successful relationship there are many considerations to make as well as establishing processes to ensure compliance and growth.
