        "q": "Do you only invest in particular areas or industries?",
        "a": "While the fund invests based on its criteria and thesis, we do consider all opportunities.

      {
        "q": "How do you weigh different criteria in your decision-making process?",
        "a": "We have developed in large part a list of objective scales. Things like a founder having previous success are rated highly but it is not necessary to meet all criteria with high marks to receive investment. Our key areas of focus are on the founder(s), the team, the product and business model so these are the highest scored areas. Other considerations made are deal structure, industry, potential scale and innovation which are important however can be largely subjective therefore ranked lower."

Afterwards we do an evaluation with considerations made and do a legal and compliance review. This process can take up to three weeks."
