## Bio

Amber began her career in Silicon Valley back in 2001, working with tech startups in varying executive finance capacities. In 2008, Amber managed Founder Fund's Angel Funds and a couple of years later was hired as the VP of Finance for Founders Fund, a venture capital firm with over $1Billion in management established by PayPal co-founder, Peter Thiel. Amber went on to explore emerging market opportunities and served as General Partner and COO for EchoVC, where she raised a $26M Sub-Saharan Africa venture capital fund to focus on investing in early-stage technology companies. While based in Lagos, Nigeria, Amber was an instrumental advocate, pioneering the creation and development of a newly emerging venture capital and entrepreneurial ecosystem across the African Continent. Amber's experience and insights around the investment landscape in Africa and Silicon Valley have been sought after on multiple continents. She is one of the few women in the VC space that can clearly articulate the opportunities to invest in Africa and into women-led startups - severely underinvested startup profiles that present the highest opportunity for arbitrage holistic growth opportunities. As a continuation of Amber’s interest in financial inclusion and decentralization, she served as Director of Finance for Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss-based not-for-for profit whose mission is to promote and support the Ethereum platform and base layer research, development and education to bring decentralized protocols and tools to the world that empower developers to produce next generation decentralized applications (dapps).

Amber is currently a mentor and advisor to several technology startups and is an amateur mycologist and cyclist in the Pacific Northwest. (Perhaps there’s still time to become an ethnobotanist and study plant medicine, too!) She has a BS in Accounting from the University of Washington. She is committed to leading with heart, integrity, and compassion in her professional and personal life.
