## History

CTR Group of Companies have spent over a decade running HFT ads compiling rich data and actionable insights into consumption. We have shifted our focus from extracting value towards deeply understanding behaviour through our compiled BIG data and we are using that to empower and measure impact by taking advantage of AI and machine learning. (https://ctr.com/)

CTR has been running a private fund of early stage disruptive investments over the past five years and there has been considerable demand to partake in these opportunities and due to  our strong network of connectors and influencers we are able to secure large chunks of allocation for the fund.

Gordy and Aaron have been partners for over 12 years and work in a realm of “Everything is Possible”.

Conscious Thought Revolution (CTR) has had the pleasure and opportunity to work with countless founders, investors and companies in the past decade. While this is not experience as a Venture Capital entity, we believe it does show traction and offers some insight into the capabilities of the founding team.

## Network Effect

We are well-connected with a diverse network of investors who are open to opportunities at an earlier stage of development. As these connections and relationships grow, we believe that CCF will be seen as a leader in the Conscious Capital space.

We have important momentum in the Venture Capital and Investments sector, In the population where \$68T is changing generational hands, where the world view is being opened up and the state of the human condition is being exposed to these new investors, we’ve seen a shift in the desire to leave a legacy of impact. Given the mindset of these enlightened investors, our approach and focus is to pursue opportunities provided by Conscious Capital (and Conscious Capitalism) to make an impact and reshape the world for a better future.

Misaligned missions and purposes are non-starters with the “new conscious” companies. These companies want to “Do Good” and have seen what results from that. “Conscious companies treat their stakeholders better. As a consequence, their suppliers are happier to do business with them. Employees are more engaged, productive, and likely to stay. These companies are more welcome in their communities and their customers are more satisfied and loyal. The most conscious companies give more, and they get more in return. The inescapable conclusion: It pays to care, widely and deeply.”

CCF aims to align the capital directly with the vision, mission and purpose of each company in which we invest. In this way, we create a symbiotic, advantageous relationship no one wants to pass on. Conscious companies and investors resonate with the vision of CCF. Doors are opened.

We are able to get into the investment opportunity sooner through warm market connections and are prepared to execute quickly. Through our experience with the network, we also have more information regarding what is available and the preferred structure of any deals. This results in an earlier stage investment (e.g., get in at seed vs Series A, or pre-seed vs seed). Typically, we have access to a larger allocation than is offered to others, the ear of the executive team, additional features such as bonus objectives and increased, more favourable opportunities to benefit from liquidity events (e.g., hold your stake or buy more, or get paid out sooner, or last money in first money out).

As the status of the VC fund rises and we show better results we receive increasingly favourable terms because of the network effect. We also provide companies that form the portfolio of CCF with a utility marriage to help them solve their problems. For example, many companies struggle with marketing and our team has a plethora of experience in that space which, depending on the stage, is critical to growth.

However, Venture Capital and investing is more than a marriage. You cannot fire your VC, so picking investments is a very big deal. With our focus and continued support, CCF founders understand that our alignment and goals will never cross with our investors. To the contrary, our continued efforts to push forward with a vision compatible with theirs creates an expanded consciousness.

We bring more than just money to the table. The knowledge that there is more to be achieved through synergy than just capital, brings in opportunities that would otherwise be impossible or simply overlooked.

## Conscious Capital

Financial capital that is raised, built, managed, and deployed strategically, for the purpose of raising human consciousness and expanding the scope of activities that can measurably improve world conditions.

It is our belief that most people are unaware of the scope and scale of suffering across the globe. The majority of us turn away when there is discussion about the plight of others…we literally switch off when television channels try to show the extent of human misery. There is denial over the needs of climate rehabilitation, the needs of refugees, suicidal tendencies and the horrors of war.

However, there are some individuals and organizations who are conscious of the extent of human need, and are willing and able to put their time and energy into making a difference. Often they lack the financial backing to be able to carry out their work. Conscious Capital describes funding that is used to invest in their initiatives and help them increase the awareness of others as a step towards achieving positive change.

We have a double ROI rule which means consciousness is key to every business we invest in, what does that mean? It means leaders innovating in management, a focus on employees, a focus on planet, people, and purpose. We know that with this rule others have experienced up to 14x increased returns in investment and an immeasurable impact in the world.

## Double ROI

We have developed a plan to measure the Return on Impact, as well as the Return on Investment of each company in the CCF portfolio – which is what we call a “Double ROI”.

The Return on Impact is judged by:

- Who the company employs
- Are those employees compensated fairly and on par with industry standard? Ie The disparity multiple between a companies highest paid employee and their lowest paid employee
- What those employees spend their money on and where
- How the employees feel (through something like a Net Promoter Score)
- Who the company contracts with, for example how much they are involved in leveraging wage discrepancies or exploitation
- Who the company’s users, clients or customers are
- How much impact the company, its products or its services have on the lives of employees and stakeholders, and how the company perceives those individuals
- What is the perceived image of the company as a whole among the general population
- What is the impact the company makes on local markets and regional economies
- How does the company show it cares.
  · How does the company rate at a macro level when compared against the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for transforming our world.
  The criteria for measuring Return on Investment for each company in the CCF include:
- How does the capital grow
- What time frame does it take the company to break even or result in net profit when exploring a new or revised revenue stream
- What does the company do with the free cash flow resulting from growth
- What do compensation structures look like
- What’s the company investing in
- Is the company creating communities of purpose.

We see data as the powerhouse of the future and with it we are able to create technology and aggregation services to ensure there is a mutually beneficial comprehension of what capital is doing, and what companies are doing to impact the world. A feedback loop is created.This results in creating accountability and transparency which are foundational cornerstones to Conscious Capitalism, and lead to an increase in the “Double ROI”.

## Vision and Mission

We have a futurist perspective because we have shown that we can read between the lines. It’s not just numbers and percentages to us, it’s about unlocking the hidden value possessed by these founders and businesses, in order to go beyond what is imaginable today.

When you’re talking about a cultural shift there is no such thing as normal. With a foundation in values and principles it’s much more than just a VC fund, it’s a Conscious Thought (R)evolution to reshape the world. It's a brand, a vision, a cause – and people on all sides of the spectrum want to be a part of it. Without even having to introduce ourselves we have strangers lining up to join the cause.

It’s more than the partners and more than the company. The cause is compelling our network to grow and include more. We look for the potential to impact a billion lives. The CCF team has a proven ability to execute and a strong track record in the space, We are motivated by passion and purpose to see a transformed world.

## The Community

Our parent company, CTR Capital, is planning to build a community that would include annual events, online sessions with guest speakers, forums and connections, an education platform, as well as myriad other things which supplement a community and allow it to flourish. It will support both sides: the limited partners investing or interested in investing, as well as the founders and companies we invest into.

The community will open the doors for investors to get access to a much larger network of individuals looking to impact the world. As well, it will provide the opportunity to pool your capital together with other individuals looking to make impact in the world. A struggle for the generational wealth changing hands is that those investors want to make impact a focus without giving up yield, but there are few opportunities or mentors to direct it. There aren’t enough deals available out there, or the requirements to assess and curate is just not feasible unless it’s a full-time thing.

This opens the doors for CTR to exist as a pre-eminent authority in the Conscious Capital space, which will allow people seeking out the impact with their capital or skills to have a place to go where a lot of the troubles are handled and the framework is set. Our goal is to foster a thriving community of companies and individuals who are looking to create the impact and live fulfilled, understanding that the problems we face today often need a new solution. We plan to provide an opportunity for limited partners and companies to share super powers, whether it be capital, skill and/or connections, with a larger community.
