## Story

Taking a taxi from New York to Washington DC when he was in his teens helped Alex to realize that money matters. The \$1,500 fare was the price he paid for an important life lesson in planning, prioritizing and spending wisely.

And he had to learn quickly, because after the taxi driver dropped him at his parents home later that day, they presented him with just three options: go back to school, get a job, or leave home. He chose to get a job. But, in fact, he created a job.

The next day he grabbed some gardening tools from the family barn and went to every home in a 2 ½ mile radius to ask if they needed yard work done. He just asked to be paid what the work was worth. At the end of that first day he presented his parents with \$700 that he had earned. They let him stay.
Just like that he was in business. And he had unexpectedly discovered an important principle that would guide him as an entrepreneur for the next 10 years – provide services that people need.

Alex expanded his yard maintenance to meet the demand for commercial maintenance, he hired others to work for him, and diversified into related fields, including industrial grill maintenance, home repair and limited additions. When looking after the land in a country club, he concluded that people with expensive cars would appreciate having their cars washed while they were playing golf.

In his twenties he was ready for a new direction, and he found it in Barnes and Noble wrapped in a book called High Powered Investing for Dummies. He read and then re-read this 4,000 page book and set about learning all he could about the stock market. After investing in equities, and futures and options trading, he hit his stride with foreign exchange.

In 2007/2008 the time was right to use his skills in FX, and there were fortunes to be made and lost. After a hectic time of earning large profits, only to see them disappear, he had learned a lot so Alex decided it was time to work with other people’s money, not just his own, and he turned to trading. Cryptocurrencies caught his attention at a time when there were just a few available. Acting on impulse, he messaged a businessman whose picture was on the front page of Forbes magazine, and much to his surprise got a reply that led him to work in the inner circles of businesses that taught him a great deal.

Then in 2013/2014, Kollan introduced him to Gordy and Aaron, and Alex joined them all in British Columbia, Canada, to work with them. He spent a considerable time learning about marketing from Aaron and he mastered all the terms used in advertising and digital marketing. Interesting though that was, Alex soon realized it was not the field he wanted to work in so he left the west coast and returned to the east coast.

By now, he wanted to invest in something more tangible, and so began to buy into rental properties. His portfolio of properties soon grew to 26, and profits were to be made. However, he was unhappy with the rate of evictions and seeing families having to give up homes because of non-payment. He also encountered dishonest property managers who were charging for repairs not completed, and so launched his own property management company. Other real estate investors were soon using his company to manage their properties which grew to 110 and he also devised a platform that could be used to alert investors to renters who might soon have to be evicted, when there were maintenance issues, late payments, etc.

As always, Alex was filling people’s needs – but his heart wasn’t in it, and he sold his properties and the related companies. He began to follow some of his other interests, such as buying and selling on Amazon and eBay. He found profitable niches and people to partner with, but it was a blow when one of those partners proved to have a gambling addiction and had partnered with a dishonest accountant to embezzle funds. Once again, Alex stepped away.

Alex had decided that loyalty, social awareness and honest dealing were other principles that he wanted to use to guide him, and at that time he re-connected with Kollan who was involved in conscious capital initiatives with Gordy and Aaron. This was an opportunity to be pay attention to raising consciousness of the human condition and to address issues such as poverty, climate change and hunger.

The early lessons about the importance of money stay with Alex, but now his focus is on raising money to improve the condition of the world and the status of others. He’s looking forward to seeing what can be achieved.
