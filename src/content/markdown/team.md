## History

### In the beginning…
 
Gordy and Aaron have been partners for over 12 years, and they like to say that they work in the realm of “Everything is Possible”. But, in the beginning, it wasn’t clear that anything at all would be possible. 
 
During the height of Pay Per Click arbitrage in 2006, Gordy discovered one of Aaron’s websites and immediately called Aaron. Aaron hung up. Gordy persisted – even getting the next flight over to Vancouver Island to meet Aaron. The next day Aaron flew to Vancouver to meet the team. Ever since then the two have been practically inseparable.
 
Over the years they continued to develop companies in the advertising industry, until a fundamental question arose: What legacy am I leaving on this world? Over the next years it grew into a mission to direct attention to build a company unlike any they had built before, one focused on contributing value, rather than extracting it.
 
### The Origins of CTR
 
Victoria, BC, rarely sees snow, but in the memorable 2006 brutal winter storm, messages were flying back and forth between Gordy and Aaron. Aaron had no power for a week and directed the process from landline. By the time Victoria returned to its usual benign weather patterns, the deal was closed

The end result was that Samsonoff Media merged with The Guide to Content Publishers, and became Qool Media a about 1 year later. The team decided to move to Victoria and make Aaron’s office the homebase for the growth of the new company. It soon ballooned to 25 local Victoria staff and 20+ outsourced staff in the Philippines, where Aaron met his wife and lived for 3 years. The teams built over 1000 niche content sites and drove HFT ad traffic to them.

During this period many networks were bridged and invites seem to have come out of nowhere, a true imposter syndrome came over Gordy, “How am I here rubbing elbows with these people.” but the message resonated so strongly and a shared fundamental question had apparently arisen in many others as well. 
After a few years of increasing competition and greater demands, Gordy was ready to move on by 2009/2010. Aaron also stepped away in 2011.  However, in 2013 their contacts began to suggest strongly that they should get back into the HFT ad space.  They put together a development team and built out an automated platform that tied into major, existing relationships and we again scaled to 8 figures annually as AdLumix.

By 2014, the focus had begun to change. Gordy and Aaron were having ongoing discussions around what we were building, its legacy, and how there was no real value for those whose lives they were touching. They both started to take the life journey seriously, and began to engage in a  lots of self-discovery activities, including going deeply into personal growth opportunities such as Landmark,Tony Robbins and multiple spiritual modalities.

Gordy and Aaron were committed to changing the world and in 2015 launched Conscious Thought Revolution (CTR). The overarching theme was: If you want change in the world it starts within.They set out along a path to creating businesses and touch points that bring awareness of the mental, emotional, physical and spiritual aspects of people’s lives. They wanted to increase awareness of how those influences affect the quality of life of each individual and the people surrounding them.

Most of 2017 was spent  in discussions between the partners on how best to harness and respect each other’s superpowers. Gordy was looking for ways to move fast without having 3 partners needed for all decision making. Aaron was looking to move out of advertising and into investing with all his focus and Haafiz wfas looking to build an empowering technology platform that helps to raise awareness and consciousness.

### Enacting the Vision of CTR
CTR is a highly-intentional, self-correcting, self-expanding, self-organizing, self-regulating technology platform that measures and expands global levels of human consciousness.
 
CTR Group of Companies have spent over a decade running HFT ads compiling rich data and actionable insights into consumption. We have shifted our focus from extracting value towards deeply understanding behaviour through our compiled BIG data and we are using that to empower and measure impact by taking advantage of AI and machine learning.
 
Following the launching of Conscious Thought Revolution, ongoing conversations shaped the concept of CTR and how best to leverage the network and desires of people to make impact in a positive way. The focus turned to some of the doors that had been opened. People wanted to use their money for good, and there really wasn’t a lot to pool and focus that capital into meaningful impact.  The partners began to question whether they could start a Venture Capital company.
 
In 2018, 3 separate high level entities were launched: CTR.ai (haafiz for technology), CTR Capital (Aaron for financial) and CTR.com Ventures -- with Gordy as keeper of the CTR vision and brand building.
 
### The CTR Conscious Capital Fund (CCF)
 
It was decided to launch the Conscious Capital Fund under the CTR Capital umbrella in 2018.
 
CTR partners had been running a private fund of early stage disruptive investments over the previous 5 years and there had been considerable demand to partake in these opportunities. The advantages of CCF are:
·         Before the fund was set up, the partners had the pleasure and opportunity of working with a number of founders, investors and companies.
·         Due to the partners’ strong network of connectors and influencers they have already been able to secure large allocations of capital for the fund.
·         The underlying investment strategy has become more refined, so there have been promising returns in the initial investments.
·         Rather than a sole focus on returns the partners also consider the impact of the investments and use the findings to provide insight into what the fund is capable of.
 
The CCF approach is modelled on some thought-provoking definitions and criteria that are emerging. For example, Peter Diamandis argues that a billionaire is no longer someone whose net worth has that dollar value. Instead, Diamandis claims that a new billionaire is someone who can affect a billion + lives. In light of this, there are a few approaches that the partners are committed to.
 
For example, the CCF focuses on innovative developments in the industries that have the potential to impact billion + people, or if the intention is to expand “consciousness” or improve individuals and their experience in this life as well the lives of others. And this has the potential for return. Where many previous Conscious VCs have failed is in placing too much focus on the impact and not a continued ability to focus on returns. With more and more B Corporations coming online, and many fundamental shifts in business, we believe the time is now for our type of investment
 
 
### Looking Forward to a Conscious Capital Community
 
The parent company, CTR Capital, is planning to build a community that would include annual events, online sessions with guest speakers, forums and connections, an education platform, as well as myriad other things which supplement a community and allow it to flourish. It will support both sides: the limited partners investing or interested in investing, as well as the founders and companies we invest into.
 
The community will open the doors for investors to get access to a much larger network of individuals looking to impact the world. As well, it will provide the opportunity to pool capital together with other individuals looking to make impact in the world. A struggle for the generational wealth changing hands is that those investors want to make impact a focus without giving up yield, but there are few opportunities or mentors to direct it. There aren’t enough deals available out there, or the requirements to assess and curate is just not feasible unless it’s a full-time thing.
 
This opens the doors for CTR to exist as a pre-eminent authority in the Conscious Capital space, which would allow people seeking out the impact with their capital or skills to have a place to go where a lot of the troubles are handled and the framework is set. The goal is to foster a thriving community of companies and individuals who are looking to create the impact and live fulfilled, understanding that the problems we face today often need a new solution. The plan is to provide an opportunity for limited partners and companies to share super powers, whether it be capital or skill, with a larger community.


## Gordy Bal
### Story
Surprisingly, we can draw a clear timeline from the Partition of India in 1947 to the launching of CTR  in Canada in 2018.  That’s just over 70 years…and it’s quite a tale. In fact, it’s the story of how Gordy Bal found himself in Victoria, British Columbia, helping to launch the Conscious Thought Revolution, and its venture capital fund, Conscious Capital.

Gordy’s father was just a young boy when India gained independence from Britain in 1947 and divided into two separate countries: India and Pakistan. The persecution and bloodshed that Gordy’s father saw as his family escaped to the Punjab left scars, even when as a grown man he emigrated to Canada.  Gordy grew up experiencing his father’s alcoholism and the abusive treatment of his mother, and from an early age he searched for the meaning of it all.
Gordy also developed a sixth sense as he did what he could as a child to anticipate angry outbursts and defuse situations.  He learned to connect the unseen dots to make life bearable in a family home that was far from Leave it to Beaver. He saw the difference that money could make and determined to become rich.

His first entrepreneurial adventures began in elementary school, where he became the middle man in helping the students to trade their valuable possessions. At the same time, he was driven to earn straight As in his academic programs because he saw them as the key to success. In high school, as a child of the Internet, he started making money online. 
While at UBC, he managed to earn a 4-year degree in 3 years, while launching several small online businesses. He was making money – but he was miserable because, to his surprize, his money wasn’t solving his problems.  He lived an unhealthy, unbalanced  lifestyle,  and was often sick and depressed. He had just convinced himself to take the LSAT when he woke on the morning of September 11th, 2001.

His existential crisis deepened as he watched the 9/11 events on television.  The feelings he had had as a child, helplessly watching his family feuding, returned and were amplified.  As before, he questioned: What is this?  He could see the effects of the media and the power structures in place. He wondered why some people had more money than others. He internalized the mass consumption and the results of fear and greed.

After graduating, he began to set up businesses with Aaron that were related to digital marketing.  As he experienced one success after another, it gradually dawned on him that he was part of the problem. He was helping to sell people things they didn’t really need. Once again he began to question the meaning of it all and turned to meditation, a healthier lifestyle and self-development.

His realization grew that humans lacked a collective consciousness that would lead them to help one another.  From his marketing experiences he knew that the Big Data gathered could help people to support one another, not just sell them stuff. The key was raising their consciousness.
And so he stepped away from his commercial activities to work with Gordy to launch the Conscious Thought Revolution in 2018 and to raise funds to invest in conscious capital. This was just the start.

## Aaron Samsonoff
### Story
Aaron didn’t have a paper route when he was a boy.  He had several.  And he was using the $2,000 he earned monthly to fund his entrepreneurial endeavours. The discipline of getting up at 4:30 in the morning to deliver newspapers turned into a lifelong habit of rising early. Thinking about Big Hairy Audacious Goals while he walked from door to door in the pre-dawn was just one inspiration for taking post-secondary courses in computer science and business.

In his twenties, Aaron began to launch online businesses, and he learned to smile at failures.  There were many.  But the smiles came because he knew that he was gaining knowledge from each failed effort that would help him to move along the path to success. In 2004, he applied all those knowledges into building his first successful digital marketing company, Samsonoff Media, which after several buyouts and mergers morphed into Qool Media. After that, successes began to overtake failures as he established more e-commerce and digital marketing initiatives.

Trusting in the Big Banks to invest and manage  the small fortune was beginning to acquire seemed like a good idea – until 2008 arrived.  Losing money was not a new experience, but it did make him decide to manage his own investments from then on.  By 2011/12, he had proved to himself that he was good at growing his own money, but was feeling the need to invest in value-driven companies that were committed to resolving issues such as environmental change, world poverty and sustainable agriculture.

He teamed up with a kindred spirit, Gordy Bal, to get involved in the new movement towards conscious capitalism. In 2016,  they created Conscious Thought Revolution(CTR) – a platform dedicated to the expansion of human consciousness.  Its stated mission is: “To shift old paradigms that no longer serve us by building, supporting and investing in radical innovations that disrupt these old paradigms in all sectors”.

Interest grew. Other investors were asking to pool their resources with Aaron and Gordy to invest in companies that were subscribing to the ideals of conscious capitalism.

So in 2018, the Conscious Capital Fund was set up under the umbrella of CTR. Its mission is to bring together like-minded investors who want to provide venture capital to companies who are raising human consciousness of the plight of the planet, in order to effect change.  The work has just begun. You are welcome to contribute and be part of the solution. Click here to find out more!

## Alexander Urban
### Story
Taking a taxi from New York to Washington DC when he was in his teens helped Alex to realize that money matters.  The $1,500 fare was the price he paid for an important  life lesson in planning, prioritizing and spending wisely.

And he had to learn quickly, because after the taxi driver dropped him at his parents home later that day, they presented him with just three options: go back to school, get a job, or leave home.  He chose to get a job. But, in fact, he created a job.

The next day he grabbed some gardening tools from the family barn and went to every home in a 2 ½ mile radius to ask if they needed yard work done.  He just asked to be paid what the work was worth.  At the end of that first day he presented his parents with $700 that he had earned.  They let him stay.

Just like that he was in business. And he had unexpectedly discovered an important principle that would guide him as an entrepreneur for the next 10 years  – provide services that people need.

Alex expanded his yard maintenance to meet the demand for commercial maintenance, he hired others to work for him, and diversified into related fields, including industrial grill maintenance, home repair and limited additions. When looking after the land in a country club, he concluded that people with expensive cars would appreciate having their cars washed while they were playing golf.

In his twenties he was ready for a new direction, and he found it in Barnes and Noble wrapped in a book called High Powered Investing for Dummies. He read and then re-read this 4,000 page book and set about learning all he could about the stock market.  After investing in equities, and futures and options trading, he hit his stride with foreign exchange.

In 2007/2008 the time was right to use his skills in FX, and there were fortunes to be made and lost.  After a hectic time of earning large profits, only to see them disappear, he had learned a lot so Alex decided it was time to work with other people’s money, not just his own, and he turned to trading.  Cryptocurrencies caught his attention at a time when there were just a few available. Acting on impulse, he messaged a businessman whose picture was on the front page of Forbes magazine, and much to his surprise got a reply that led him to work in the inner circles of businesses that taught him a great deal.

Then in 2013/2014, Kollan introduced him to Gordy and Aaron, and Alex joined them all in British Columbia, Canada, to work with them.  He spent a considerable time learning about marketing from Aaron and he mastered all the terms used in advertising and digital marketing.  Interesting though that was, Alex soon realized it was not the field he wanted to work in so he left the west coast and returned to the east coast.

By now,  he wanted to invest in something more tangible, and so began to buy into rental properties. His portfolio of properties soon grew to 26, and profits were to be made.  However, he was unhappy with the rate of evictions and seeing families having to give up homes because of non-payment.  He also encountered dishonest property managers who were charging for repairs not completed, and so launched his own property management company.  Other real estate investors were soon using his company to manage their properties which grew to 110 and he also devised a platform that could be used to alert investors to renters who might soon have to be evicted, when there were maintenance issues, late payments, etc.

As always, Alex was filling people’s needs – but his heart wasn’t in it, and he sold his properties and the related companies. He began to follow some of his other interests, such as buying and selling on Amazon and eBay.  He found profitable niches and people to partner with, but it was a blow when one of those partners proved to have a gambling addiction and had partnered with a dishonest accountant to embezzle funds.  Once again, Alex stepped away.

Alex had decided that loyalty, social awareness and  honest dealing were other principles that he wanted to use to guide him, and at that time he re-connected with Kollan who was involved in conscious capital initiatives with Gordy and Aaron.  This was an opportunity to be pay attention to raising consciousness of the human condition and to address issues such as poverty, climate change and hunger.

The early lessons about the importance of money stay with Alex, but now his focus is on raising money to improve the condition of the world and the status of others.  He’s looking forward to seeing  what can be achieved.

## Kollan House
### Story
As the son of a physician in the military, Kollan had been used to moving around.  But he became the man of the house when he was only 5.  His parents were separating and as the older brother of a two younger siblings, he felt it was up to him to help his mother.  Perhaps it was those early responsibilities that prepared him for a life of running things.  

Kollan grew up looking after his younger brother and sister while his mother worked long hours to support them. Often they had to rely on food stamps,  but life was good apart from that.  What he recalls about his Christian elementary school was that his essay on the adaptation of plants got a low grade because it championed evolution, and such ideas were not welcome. However, his father in particular encouraged scientific thought, and became more of an influence when Kollan lived with him in Kentucky through his high school years.

Kollan moved out on his own at 18, and suffered through a period of depression.  Engineering school called, and he started working to support himself. UPS, based in Kentucky, had program to fund students if they would work the third, overnight shift. Kollan was soon promoted to manager and took management training. Before too long he was supervising 40 people. 

But it was difficult to keep up with his studies, and Kollan decided to focus on engineering. In his third year, his aptitude for business was evident as he started getting work building websites and helping people with their computers. He was ahead of the curve because he understood the value of having an online presence, but it was an uphill battle to persuade others.
   
Kollan’s early goal was to build spaceships. He had wanted to be pilot, and he earned his private pilot’s license.  He also loved to make things with his hands, and won an art scholarship – which he declined because he realized that he was unlikely to turn it into a successful career.  Elon Musk was his hero and it was the early days of Burt Rutan’s race into space. When he realized that it took a million dollars to fund space travel,  and that it was mainly wealthy businessmen who had those resources, he turned his attention to business studies.

Around this time, Kollan’s father was involved in some startups, such as a black limo taxi service for airline passengers. Kollan worked with him and learned quickly that there were a lot of regulatory bodies who needed to be satisfied.  Ultimately, that business failed, but it gave him a good idea of what was needed to survive.  He and a friend started another limo service, this time shuttling people around who were attending the Kentucky Derby. However, his friend proved unreliable, and and he left Kollan to deal with a shambles.

Kollan was left feeling depressed and living in his parents basement. Even with help for the depression, he could find no meaning in his life, and he attempted suicide.  He was saved from a fatal  jump from a 7-storey building by getting caught up in some wires. He was surrounded by love as a result and it was almost as though he had died and gone to heaven.  People were worried that he would try suicide again, but he felt he had survived his best efforts to kill himself, so he focused on finding meaning by reading such authors as Eckhart Tolle.  

Life took a new turn when Kollan met Alex and Tim at a Hackathon in Washington. They invited him to move from Kentucky to join them in Baltimore to work in the field of cryptocurrency. Even though he was still limping from his fall, he moved in with them in their cramped quarters and 
that was the start of a very exciting time when they motivated each other to do well.

Then Kollan met up with Gordy and Aaron and came to BC – originally with Tim and Alex, but eventually they moved back to the US.  During the past  4 years in BC, Kollan has struggled to be a successful entrepreneur and feels he has grown and found his own voice.  He has discovered that there is a greater willingness to collaborate on the west coast and fewer man-eat-man business dealings. 

Kollan has learned from Gordy and Aaron about why conscious capital matters.  He has worn many different hats, and has develop his innate abilities to be adaptable and problem solve.  He has enjoyed applying the scientific method he learned as an engineer to efficiently solve challenges that involve humans.    
Now Kollan has a 20-year plan to be successful in business – and he then he wants to build a spaceship.
