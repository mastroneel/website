## Story

Aaron didn’t have a paper route when he was a boy. He had several. And he was using the $2,000 he earned monthly to fund his entrepreneurial endeavours. The discipline of getting up at 4:30 in the morning to deliver newspapers turned into a lifelong habit of rising early. Thinking about Big Hairy Audacious Goals while he walked from door to door in the pre-dawn was just one inspiration for taking post-secondary courses in computer science and business.

In his twenties, Aaron began to launch online businesses, and he learned to smile at failures. There were many. But the smiles came because he knew that he was gaining knowledge from each failed effort that would help him to move along the path to success. In 2004, he applied all those knowledges into building his first successful digital marketing company, Samsonoff Media, which after several buyouts and mergers morphed into Qool Media. After that, successes began to overtake failures as he established more e-commerce and digital marketing initiatives.

Trusting in the Big Banks to invest and manage the small fortune was beginning to acquire seemed like a good idea – until 2008 arrived. Losing money was not a new experience, but it did make him decide to manage his own investments from then on. By 2011/12, he had proved to himself that he was good at growing his own money, but was feeling the need to invest in value-driven companies that were committed to resolving issues such as environmental change, world poverty and sustainable agriculture.

He teamed up with a kindred spirit, Gordy Bal, to get involved in the new movement towards conscious capitalism. In 2016, they created Conscious Thought Revolution(CTR) – a platform dedicated to the expansion of human consciousness. Its stated mission is: “To shift old paradigms that no longer serve us by building, supporting and investing in radical innovations that disrupt these old paradigms in all sectors”.

Interest grew. Other investors were asking to pool their resources with Aaron and Gordy to invest in companies that were subscribing to the ideals of conscious capitalism.

So in 2018, the Conscious Capital Fund was set up under the umbrella of CTR. Its mission is to bring together like-minded investors who want to provide venture capital to companies who are raising human consciousness of the plight of the planet, in order to effect change. The work has just begun. You are welcome to contribute and be part of the solution. Click here to find out more!
