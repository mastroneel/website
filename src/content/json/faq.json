      {
        "q": "How do you weigh different criteria in your decision-making process?",
        "a": "We have developed in large part a list of objective scales. Things like a founder having previous success are rated highly but it is not necessary to meet all criteria with high marks to receive investment. Our key areas of focus are on the founder(s), the team, the product and business model so these are the highest scored areas. Other considerations made are deal structure, industry, potential scale and innovation which are important however can be largely subjective therefore ranked lower."

        "q": "How do you get access to deals?",
        "a": "We, the fund, utilize two main strategies, the first being passive, having cultivated a network of investors and entrepreneurs who have their ear to the ground they send us deals, they have vetted through and believe meet the funds thesis. The second being active and aggressive, we passionately search physical and online avenues for founders and companies that are providing solutions to problems we see stone walling the path of the funds vision.

        "q": "What is your due diligence strategy?",
        "a": "We have inbound deal flow which hits the first screening process, from there we build a list of questions related to the industry, market and business itself to be reviewed and then asked of the founding team, we then do comprehensive due diligence and at any point in time we have additional questions we will construct and have a meeting with the team to answer. Afterwards we do an evaluation with considerations made and do a legal and compliance review. This process can take up to three weeks.  First, inbound deal flow, we look at the opportunities and perform an initial review of the business as it has been presented to us, we look into the industry and market, the background of the team, outline the opportunity and produce a list of questions we have for the founding team to help fill in the gaps marketing materials may leave.  Second, we have an initial call where we get introduced (if it hasn’t happened already) as well as have the initial set of questions answered. If these are well answered then we will move into the third stage.  Third, we perform our comprehensive due diligence where we have our research team create a report on the market opportunity, industry, product, team, and business model, we will also review the legal structure. During this time we may have questions created which will then be reviewed and prepared for additional conversations with the founding team.  Fourth, we have a meeting with our team which we outline the findings assess the opportunity and then vote on a decision of how to proceed.  Fifth, we will have the legal team review all documents and ensure everything is prepared and the investment is ready to be made."

        "a": "If a company is looking for increased speed and market share dominance, without having to settle legal battles later or wash their mind of less than legitimate means, they should partner with CTR.

        "q": "What is your stance on diversity and inclusion?",
        "a": "“We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.” Albert Einstein.  We believe that indeed you cannot solve the problems with the same thinking used when they were created and as such you require the diverse thought and inclusion to produce a desired result. Not to mention the countless studies produced over the last decade indicating that diversity leads to better results, more novel approaches and unique solutions, but also the understanding that the world we hope to create is a diverse world with many different ideas and opportunities. CTR cannot lead that charge, it will the people who are a part of the vision and mission who do.  Therefore we look to have diversity and inclusion at every level of all that we do."

        "q": "How do you help your companies hire?",
        "a": "Through our own experience, our work with recruiters as well as setting up winning processes. Great hiring is something that comes with the experience of doing it, each business has its own unique environment and culture so we work with team members to develop and understand what is needed and what those “make it or break it” points are. Like any successful relationship there are many considerations to make as well as establishing processes to ensure compliance and growth. We take culture and team as one of the highest priorities and indicators for success of a startup so it’s something which is often overlooked, to the extreme detriment of the company."

        "a": "As with any business timing is everything. CTR in the past has done many private placements and during that period we have built a strong network of individuals who align with the mission and vision of CTR. We see the need for conscious investing and a need for a conscious thought revolution as paramount for the continued development of humanity. The previous success of the private placements and the desire of our network to continue to have the impact of consciousness measured and grown has lead us into a unique opportunity of timing. The capital and the opportunities have met and it is this time we’re in a position to develop and operate a fund to enact that vision and lead the revolution."
