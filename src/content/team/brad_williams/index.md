## Story

Brad is a passionate entrepreneur and over the last 15 years has held, CEO, President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer roles for companies. Brad has assisted in raising over $30 million in funds, led the sales and diligence processes for several exits (including a $370M exit), lead and completed 3 CPC (capital pool companies) processes, completed a CCAA restructuring and more.

From go-public transactions to company acquisitions to major financial restructuring, he's overseen a diverse array of financial processes at companies ranging from pre-revenue enterprises to rapidly growing ventures. As the finance head of one of the largest non-bank FX payment processors, he was responsible for the finance and diligence processes of a $25M private equity investment and $370M exit transaction. Subsequent to the completion of the exit transaction, he was Vice President of Global Business Expansion and was responsible for an aggressive 24-month growth strategy, responsible for developing and implementing plans to triple regional coverage and revenues.

Brad Williams is a fractional executive (mostly CFO, but also COO/President), who has worked with a wide variety of companies and industries over the last 20 years. During this time Brad has been involved in raising well over $100M in capital into companies (debt and equity), and played the key finance role in 10 sell side transactions ($450M).

His sweet spot is being involved in any company that is going through a significant time of growth and/or transition and is disproportionately excited about building models, doing strategic cohort analysis or running the "One Page Plan" (strategic planning/operating process) inâ€¦. Excel!

Brad is also actively involved in the advisory and mentoring communities that are regularly engaged with people and companies at all stages. He currently sits on the board of Power to Be, the finance committee at Victoria Foundation and was a past board member for six years at VIATEC.

His wide-ranging career has seen him hold the senior finance role at six different tech and financial service companies over 10 years.

Brad has more than 20 years of experience in growing and scaling technology companies. He has a significant buy and sell side M&A experience (largest exit \$370M USD) and has successfully been involved/closed seed, growth and late stage financings.

Brad has been a founder in four different companies, and advised and mentored more than 50 start up and growth stage companies. He is actively involved in the Victoria tech & volunteer community serving on the board's of Viatec and Power to Be as Treasurer.

When not working though, Brad is more than happy to disconnect from it all and do almost any self propelled outdoor activity, preferable in a new country while exploring small towns and villages looking for good food and wine.
